# Portfolio Project - HTML, TailwindCSS, and JavaScript

## Introduction

In this project, we create an impressive and responsive **portfolio website** using **HTML**, **TailwindCSS**, and **JavaScript**. The portfolio showcases key sections like an introduction, services, projects, testimonials, and contact details, making it the perfect representation of a personal or professional profile. The portfolio is designed to be visually appealing, fully responsive, and functional across all devices.

## Project Overview

### HTML
We start by building the **structure** of the portfolio with HTML. The portfolio consists of several key sections:
- **Navbar**: Featuring the name and navigation tools like Home, About, Services, Projects, Testimonials, and Contact.
- **Introduction Section**: A personal introduction to introduce yourself.
- **Our Services Section**: Highlights professional services offered.
- **Our Projects Section**: Displays a collection of projects.
- **Testimonials Section**: Features user feedback and experiences.
- **Contact Section**: Provides a way for visitors to reach out.

### TailwindCSS
Once the structure is built, we use **TailwindCSS** to style the portfolio. Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework that helps us:
- Set a **black background** for a sleek design.
- **Style the navbar** to make it look visually appealing and ensure it is **sticky** at the top.
- Design the entire portfolio step-by-step, ensuring a clean, modern look for each section (Introduction, Services, Projects, Testimonials, Contact, etc.).
- Ensure the website is **fully responsive**, making sure it adapts to any screen size.

### JavaScript
Finally, we add interactivity using **JavaScript**:
- We target the **navbar** to make it sticky at the top of the page.
- We add functionality to toggle the **navbar visibility** on mobile devices by switching the display from `none` to `block` when the navbar logo is clicked.

## Key Features
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout that adapts to all screen sizes.
- **Interactive Navbar**: A sticky navbar with mobile-friendly toggle functionality.
- **Project Showcase**: Section dedicated to showcasing recent projects.
- **Testimonial Slider**: A swiper for displaying user feedback.
- **Professional Look**: Clean, modern design using TailwindCSS.
